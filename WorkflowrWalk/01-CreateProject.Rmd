### Create Project 

#### Start Project

In the `Console` tab:

```{r c2, eval=FALSE}
wflow_start("PROJECT_NAME")
```
1. What does `wflow_start` do?
    + Creates a directory that contains all starting files
    + Changes your current directory to PROJECT_NAME 
    + Starts a Git repo which we will connect to GitLab repository 

2. What is the `analysis` folder for?
    + Contains all source R Markdown files (Rmd)
        + Includes: `index.rmd`
            + Contains no R code but generates `index.html` which eventally runs the entire project
    + Contains `_site.yml`
        + Allows user to edit theme, navigation bar, menus ect. 
        + Helpful [link]( https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html) to customizing

    
3. What is the `docs` folder for?
    + Contains all HTML files for website 
        + Note that this file will be empty until we build the project 
        + Each HTML file is built from a corresponding Rmd file in the analysis folder
    + Contains any figures created by Rmd files


4. What about the data, code and output files?
    + These files are there for your use and thus can be deleted if desired

#### Build Project

In the `Console` tab:

```{r c3, eval=FALSE}
wflow_build()
```
1. What does `wflow_build()` do? 
    + Builds all the R Markdown files in analysis and saves their HTML in docs
    + Displays the website
    
Your website should like simialr to the image of mine shown below (except with a Publish tab instead of a Dates tab) 

```{r, c4, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Workflow_Photos/sample_wf.png')
```


#### View Project

At any time you can view the current site on your local machine by typing in the `Console` tab:

```{r c5, eval=FALSE}
wflow_view()
```

#### Publish Website 

Currently our project is simply an HTML file stored on our laptop, publishing the website will make it available online.

In the `Console` tab:

```{r c6, eval=FALSE}
wflow_status()
```

This allows you to view which files are published or unpublished currently.

Now we want to publish our page the command to do so takes three parts

1. c - Commit
2. ("analysis/index.Rmd", "analysis/about.Rmd", "analysis/license.Rmd"), - A character vector of the Rmd files you want published
    + It may be eaiser to place ("*.Rmd") here to use all the files
3. "Publish the initial files" -  A commit message to be posted 

Overall, `wflow_publish` is a quick and error-free way for us to commit and push all of our Rmd files to GitLab at once. 

In the `Console` tab:

```{r c7, eval=FALSE}
wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd", "analysis/about.Rmd", "analysis/license.Rmd"), "Publish the initial files for PROJECT_NAME")
```
